# Control Flow Analysis in CLSL

> **Note**: This documentation is generated and maintained with the assistance of AI/LLM tools. While we strive for accuracy, please verify critical information and report any inconsistencies.

## Overview

CLSL employs sophisticated control flow analysis to transform unstructured C# IL code into structured shader code. This document details the implementation of control flow analysis, focusing on dominator trees and loop detection.

## Control Flow Graph

### Basic Block Structure
```
label:
    instruction1
    instruction2
    terminator_instruction
```

### Edge Types
1. **Unconditional** - Direct flow from one block to another
2. **Conditional** - Branching based on a condition
3. **Return** - Function exit points

## Dominator Tree Analysis

The dominator tree is a core data structure that helps identify program structure:

### Properties
- A node D dominates node N if all paths from the entry to N must go through D
- Immediate dominator of N is the closest dominator in the dominator tree
- Forms a tree structure useful for identifying loops and control structures

### Example Structure:
```
       A          Dominator Tree:
      / \               A
     B   D           / | | \
    / \ / \         B  D E  F
   C   E  |         |
    \ /   |         C
     F <--*
```

### Implementation
The implementation handles:
- Single node cases
- Self-loops
- Complex control flow with multiple paths
- Nested control structures

## Loop Detection

### Loop Structure
```
Header:
    condition
    branch Body/Exit
Body:
    ...code...
    branch Header
Exit:
    ...continuation...
```

### Analysis Process
1. Identify back edges in the CFG
2. Find natural loops using dominators
3. Build loop hierarchy
4. Detect loop conditions and exits

## Control Flow Structuring

### Transformation Rules
1. **If-Then-Else**
   ```
   if condition:
       then_block
   else:
       else_block
   endif
   ```

2. **Loops**
   ```
   loop:
       break_if exit_condition
       ...loop body...
       continue
   endloop
   ```

3. **Break/Continue**
   - Map to appropriate WGSL constructs
   - Handle multiple exit points
   - Structure multi-level breaks

## Special Cases

### Early Returns
- Transform to structured form
- Maintain semantic equivalence
- Handle nested returns

### Switch Statements
- Lower to if-else chains
- Optimize common patterns
- Handle fall-through cases

### Exception Handling
- Not supported in shaders
- Must be eliminated during compilation
- Convert to error codes where necessary

## Validation

### Structural Validation
- Well-formed loop structures
- Proper nesting
- Valid entry/exit points

### Semantic Validation
- Control flow preservation
- Value availability
- Side effect ordering
